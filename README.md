<h3>About:</h3>

This repository contains my studies of the Python language and its libraries with a focus on Data Analysis. To this end, I'm following the Python Fundamentals for Data Analysis 3.0 course, which is a course with 13 content modules, plus an introduction and a final assessment, totaling 15 modules.

The course will explore content such as data processing, Database Manipulation in Python, TensorFlow, and Web Scraping, as well as the libraries for this purpose. As a complement, I'm including some other courses to deepen and fix knowledge, which can be found at the end of this ``README``.
